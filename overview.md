Welcome to the Load Order Library API. Here you can learn how to use the API to request a list of all non-private lists, get a specific one, and do list comparisons. The intended purpose of this API, in addition to powering the main site itself, is to allow 3rd party tools such as the Wildlander launcher to be able to upload lists and compare them to help support in identifying issues.

The main route for API requests is `https://api.loadorderlibrary.com/v1`


>	API docs are a work in progress. If you notice something confusing or wrong, please don't hesitate to contact me!

>	API is currently connected to the test database for testing. Lists being created **will** be deleted/lost and will **not** show up on the main site.
