Welcome to the Load Order Library API docs. Here you can learn how to use the API to manage lists, get your user info, get game info, etc.

The main route for API requests is `https://api.loadorderlibrary.com/v1`

:::caution
Please send all requests with an `Accept: application/json` header. Otherwise you will sometimes get HTML returned back due to the nature of the underlying framework.
