# Authentication

At the moment there is no need to authenticate as no user-tied data is present in the API. In the future one will be able to generate an API key from their user account for usage with 3rd party programs.

>	Please send all requests with an `Accept: application/json` header. Otherwise you will sometimes get HTML returned back due to the nature of the underlying framework.
