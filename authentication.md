User authentication is only necessary for existing users that wish to interact with their account via the API. Anonymous users have many of the same abilities as those using accounts. The largest exceptions are the ability to edit and delete lists.

More info on getting an authentication token will be available as I work on the API and implement it myself.

>	Please send all requests with an `Accept: application/json` header. Otherwise you will sometimes get HTML returned back due to the nature of the underlying framework.

To use your existing account with the API, generate an API Token.
